# Capstone-Project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
- This project, called WatchThis, is a web app I created for my Foundations Capstone Project at Devmountain.
- WatchThis is an app that allows users to keep track of which shows/movies they've watched and which ones they want to watch in the future.
- I built this app because I love movies and tv and thought it would be useful to have an independent, centralized way of keeping track of what shows and movies I've watched
  and want to watch regardless of which service they're streaming on.
  
TECH STACK
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- The Open Movie Database API
  
FEATURES
- Users can enter a show or movie title in the search bar and click 'search', which prompts them to either add the title to the "want to watch" list or to cancel the process.
- Users can add multiple titles to both lists and the list containers expand to include them.
- In the "want to watch" list, clicking the arrow beneath the movie title moves that title to the "watched" list
